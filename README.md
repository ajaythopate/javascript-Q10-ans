In this example, we have an HTML input field where users can enter their search query. The fetchSearchResults function is responsible for fetching and displaying search results. We create a debounced version of this function called debouncedFetch using the debounce function. The debouncedFetch function will be executed only if there is a 500ms delay between consecutive input events.

By debouncing the fetchSearchResults function, we ensure that the API call to fetch search results is only triggered when the user pauses typing for at least 500ms. This prevents excessive API calls and improves performance by reducing unnecessary requests.
